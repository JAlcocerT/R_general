My own general user defined function (UDF) in R.

### List and description:

* Cumulative_difference: given a DF and a column names, it returns the DF with an extra column being the cumulative difference of the selected column
* Months_start: given a DF from the library BatchGetSymbols, to take beginning or end of the month data only
